We are not officially affiliated to any specific academic/service unit, but housed at the Center on Research and Evaluation (CORE) at SMU. The membership of the QML is cross-institutional, and its members actively study and collaborate on various research topics on quantitative methods and psychometrics in behavioral science and educational research.\nMembers\nDirector\nAkihito Kamata is a Professor at Southern Methodist University (Department of Education Policy & Leadership, and Department of Psychology). His primary research interest is psychometrics and educational and psychological measurement, focusing on implementation of item-level test data analysis methodology through various modeling framework, including item response theory, multilevel modeling, and structural equation modeling.\nFaculty / Staff\nYusuf Kara is a Senior Program Manager at the Center on Research and Evaluation at Simmons School of Education and Human Development, SMU. His research interests primarily focus on contemporary psychometric methods such as multilevel item response modeling, structural equation modeling, and mediation analysis.\nXinya Liang is Assistant Professor of Educational Statistics and Research Methods at the College of Education and Health Professions, University of Arkansas. Her research interests includes Structural equation modeling, Bayesian data analysis, Multilevel modeling, Measurement Invariance, and Large-Scale Assessment.\nChalie Patarapichayatham is a Research Assistant Professor at Simmons School of Education and Human Development at SMU. Her research interests include psychometrics, educational measurement, and statistical analyses of test data, focuses mainly on item-level psychometric analysis, growth modeling, and latent-class analysis.\nCornelis Potgieter is Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Texas Christian University (TCU). His research interests includes Nonparametric statistics, applications of characteristic functions, spatial statistics, capture-recapture methods, measurement error and latent variable models, generalized skew-symmetric distributions.\nXin Qiao is a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Simmons School of Education and Human Development at SMU, funded by two IES grants.
